## Conclusions
- The Random Sample algorithm give us better solutions for the jssp problem.
- The Random Sample algorithm takes less time per loop to run. That's why it founds more soluttions to the same instance.
- The Genetic algorithm barely improves over time. 
- This is a basic Genetic Algorithm, it can be improved to find better results.
- Sometimes, it may be better to just go with random solutions.
